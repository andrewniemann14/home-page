      <h4>What's involved</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
        <li>lots of recursion</li>
        <li>Very basic HTML/CSS</li>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        The idea came from using JSON in an early project, something my father asked me to build for him.
        The product used JSON files containing information that he would add to periodically.
        The JSON formatting was too complicated for him to edit, so he would email me the information, and I would put it into the files that fed into his program.
        I thought a tool that removed the syntax and just let him plug in values would be useful.
        I found something online, but I liked the idea of building my own as a learning experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thought was to build it using Java and FXML, but decided to go with JavaScript and display the JSON as plain HTML.
        That way it would be easily accessible online.
        In order to gain familiarity with basic JavaScript, I planned to make it with vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks or libraries of any kind.

      <h4>Step 1: Take a JSON file and display it in HTML</h4>
      <p>
        In order to use this with any future JSON files, especially ones with an unknown structure,
        I would need to recursively read the JSON and build an HTML structure to match.

      <pre class="code-quote">
        fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
          json = data;
          <span class="code-focus">printJson(json, topDiv)</span>;
        })
      </pre>
    </div>
